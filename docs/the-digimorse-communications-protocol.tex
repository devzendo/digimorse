        \noindent
        This document introduces an experimental alternative to amateur radio's traditional way of transmitting Morse
        Code. It describes the rationale for, and the design of the digimorse communications protocol. It describes
        choices made at all stages of its implementation in the transceiver software.
    \end{abstract}

    \newthought{The digimorse communications protocol exists} to bring together two aspects of amateur radio that I
    particularly
    enjoy, to see if the benefits of one aspect might improve my enjoyment of the other.
    Namely, to see if digital encoding and error correction\footnote{Such as found in the WSJT-X weak-signal mode
    software by Joe Taylor K1JT et al.} might be used to provide a significant coding gain and a removal of noise
    from Morse Code - our historic mode of communication.

    Other features of modern digital operation that I aim to bring to Morse operation with digimorse include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{-0.5em}
        \item a waterfall display
        \item active station information
        \item meaningful signal reports
    \end{itemize}

    Waterfall displays are now standard features on modern SDR\footnote{Software Defined Radio} transceivers such as
    the Yaesu FTDX10, and in software such as WSJT-X\cite{FT4FT8}.
    They graphically show the presence of any signals - and information about their senders - across the receiver's
    audio bandwidth.
    The decode window of WSJT-X shows the content of the decoded messages that have been received in recent
    receive cycles.
    With this display it is easy to see who is currently active on the band, how strong their signals are, and their
    country/locator square.
    This gives an excellent overview of propagation conditions and band activity.
    Signal reports are automatically derived from the incoming signal strength, and are therefore meaningful – rather
    than the typical ‘you are 5 by 9… what was your name and callsign again?’.

    With digimorse, since the Morse code you send is encoded and decoded digitally, if the receiving station
    achieves a successful decode, the code will be played back exactly as it was sent, with no noise.

    In amateur radio, Morse code is traditionally transmitted using a pure sinusoidal radio wave, oscillating at a
    fixed frequency. This gives rise to the name and acronym it is more commonly known as: Continuous Wave, or CW.
    This method of transmitting Morse originated around 1913, with the invention of the \emph{vacuum tube electronic
    oscillator} by Edwin Armstrong and Alexander Meissner\footnote{See Wikipedia, 'Continuous wave'}. Prior to this,
    Morse was transmitted using primitive \emph{spark gap} transmitters, which created much electromagnetic
    interference, and had wide bandwidth. They were outlawed in 1934. The bandwidth of a CW signal is very low,
    compared to the systems it replaced\cite{Amos}.

    Perhaps surprisingly, CW, as a method of transmitting Morse code
    using radio, has not changed significantly since then. In the intervening years, great improvements to receiver
    technology have been made: receiver sensitivity and selectivity have improved; filtering and digital signal
    processing techniques have been applied to try to reduce or remove the noise that plagues reception.

    However, despite these advances, noise and fading effects introduced by ionospheric reflection still impact our
    ability to receive and decode Morse, as received using CW signals.

    As an analogy, digimorse intends to do to Morse code what compact discs did for vinyl recordings. It's an upgrade
    for CW.

    This paper introduces digimorse in the context of modern digital communications protocols for the radio amateur.

\section{Overview of the digimorse transceiver}
    \newthought{A view of the functions of the digimorse transceiver}, to be explored more fully in later sections.

\subsection{Transmission}

    The digimorse software uses real, hand-sent Morse Code - not typed, computer-generated 'perfect' Morse - but keyed
    on a straight key, or paddle\footnote{Only straight keys are currently supported.}.
    The key or paddle is attached to the computer via an Arduino-based USB interface which samples your keying,
    sending a stream of millisecond-precise key up/down durations to the computer.
    In addition to sampled keying information, several other ‘metadata’ items are included in the outgoing stream of
    frames – callsign, location, keying speed and power.
    This stream is then compressed, protected by a CRC\footnote{Cyclic Redundancy Check.} error-detection code, then
    enhanced with an LDPC\footnote{Low-Density Parity-Check} error-correction code\cite{Gallager1962} - similar to
    that used in FT4/FT8.
    These measures mitigate the effects of noise and other interference during receive, thereby improving the ability
    of the software to correctly decode extremely weak signals.
    These blocks of data are then prefixed with a Costas array\cite{Hasselbeck2019}, to allow the receiver to 
    precisely filter the frame stream from the rest of the received audio.
    The complete stream is then modulated into a narrow bandwidth of tones, taking care to minimise splatter.
    Many such transmissions can occur simultaneously within a transceiver’s 3kHz SSB bandwidth.
    The resultant audio is then transmitted.

\subsection{Reception}

    The receiver detects all narrow-bandwidth digimorse signals across its 3kHz incoming audio bandwidth by searching
    for their initial Costas arrays.
    After demodulation, error detection and correction is applied, and if the stream is valid, the detected metadata
    frames are displayed above each stream of keying information so that you can easily see who is
    transmitting, from where, how strong their signals are, and how fast they are keying.
    Given this scrolling display of decoded streams, you may select individual signals, or apply a bandpass filter
    across part of the receive bandwidth.
    The result is that the single selected signal - or multiple filtered signals - are then decoded, and
    reconstituted into high-quality Morse code, with no noise.
    Each stream is located at some audio offset from the start of the 3kHz receiver bandwidth, and this offset is used
    as the tone for each signal.
    The inclusion of LDPC error correction information means that even if your RF signal is very weak at the
    receiver, with high levels of noise present, then some or all of your transmission should be decodable, giving a
    considerable coding gain over CW~\cite{Punch2013}.

\section{Digital Communications Systems}
\newthought{The overview presented above will now be expanded upon} by reviewing a generic
    digital communications system, and then explaining how each of its building
    blocks is implemented in digimorse.

    Claude Shannon presented a high-level variant of the following diagram in his seminal paper "A Mathematical
    Theory of Communication"\cite{Shannon1948}. The diagram shown below is a modern enhancement for digital
    communication systems.

    All of the modern digital communication systems you might use adhere to this same basic structure.

    \begin{figure*}[h]
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/digital-communication-system}
        \caption{Basic elements of a digital communications system}
        \label{fig:digcomms}
    \end{figure*}

    % EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON HERE AT THE HIGH LEVEL

    The diagram starts at the top-left, and illustrates the path taken by some information (a \emph{message}) from
    its source, to its eventual destination.
    The source could be analogue or digital, and is encoded into some digital form, such that it can be expressed in
    as few binary digits as possible.
    The output of the source encoder should exhibit as little \emph{redundancy} as possible; it should be as
    \emph{compressed} as possible.

    The resulting \emph{information sequence} is then fed to the channel encoder, which is tasked with preparing it
    for its journey through the channel.
    This is achieved by adding some redundancy back into the information, but in a structured manner, such that it
    can be used by the receiver to overcome the effects of noise and interference presented by the transmission over
    the channel.
    The reliability of decoding during reception is increased by this added redundancy.

    The binary output of the channel encoder must be converted into a form suitable for transmission over the
    channel: this is the function of the digital modulator, which typically maps binary data into electrical signal
    waveforms.

    The channel is the physical medium through which the signal is sent from transmitter to receiver. In amateur
    radio, this is the atmosphere, either a transmission via ground wave or sky wave. In either case, the signal is
    subject to interference, and is corrupted randomly by noise generated by other electronic devices, atmospheric
    noise (e.g. lightning discharges), human-generated noise such as car ignition noise or other switching. It can
    also be subject to various types of fading, multipath reflection, doppler effects, etc.


	% TODO discuss digital demodulator
	% TODO discuss channel decoder
	% TODO discuss source decoder
	% TODO discuss output transducer
	

    Starting with Morse code, I will now discuss each of these building blocks in turn, and their design and implementation in digimorse.


\section{digimorse as a Digital Communications System}
    \newthought{Before taking several deep dives} into the building blocks, let's zoom out a little further, and look at the whole of digimorse - as there are additional parts that don't appear in the previous description of generic digital communications systems. 


%TODO include full block diagram

	    
    % FRAME THE PROBLEM AND PROVIDE MOTIVATION AND BACKGROUND. SAY WHAT THE PROBLEM IS, STATE THE OUTPUT AND KEY IDEA
    % BEFORE DISCUSSING STEPS.

\section{Information Source and Input Transducer}

Morse key and Arduino, keying protocol, USB Serial, protocol decoder, keying event stream.
how the protocol decoder is wired to other block diagram elements.

\section{Source Encoder}
Given a stream of keying information from the input layer, this must be encoded into a compressed form to remove redundancy, ensuring that the minimum number of bits are used (since the transmission of bits takes time; fewer bits are better).


The\marginnote{They're not 'dot' and 'dash' although those terms are in common use. Morse in  amateur radio is an \emph{audible} language, and the \emph{sounds} are \emph{di} and \emph{dah} with \emph{dit} used if it is the final element of a letter. 'S' is \emph{di-di-dit} not \emph{dot-dot-dash}.} digimorse transceiver accommodates keying speeds of 5 to 60 words per minute. There are three major \emph{timing elements} in Morse: the \emph{dit}, the \emph{dah}   and the \emph{wordgap}.\marginnote{A clear description of the elements and how they are used to form words is given by Michael Maynard K4ICY, illustrating the 'standard word' \textsc{PARIS}, used for calculating keying speed in words-per-minute.}\cite{Maynard}

A table showing the durations in milliseconds for these three elements, for all speeds in this range is given in the appendix on page~\pageref{tab:morsetab}. The longest element that could be transmitted 

\hl{The CQ detector goes here?} As this block knows the keying stream, and the chosen WPM. It can also measure the variance of the three elements, and show the actual WPM. Decoding Morse from an audio signal is hard due to noise (TODO \hl{Is there a link to Mauri's work I can find, illustrating this?})
